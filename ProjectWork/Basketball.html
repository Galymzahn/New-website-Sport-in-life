            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                Basketball is a team sport played on a flat, rectangular court in which players shoot a ball into a hoop in order to score. Each team has five players who try to score in a goal at one end of the court and defend the goal at the opposite end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basketball is known for its fast-paced and dynamic gameplay. It requires a combination of skills such as dribbling, shooting, passing, and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is played in four quarters, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are scored by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop. Different types of shots, including three-pointers and dunks, contribute varying point values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basketball has a massive global following and is played at various levels, from recreational to professional leagues like the NBA (National Basketball Association).
